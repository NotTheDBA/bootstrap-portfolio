# Bootstrap Portfolio
# A responsive web portfolio

This projects uses the same structure as `Basic-Portfolio` (<https://notthedba.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/index.html)>, but uses media queries to present three different layouts depending on the overall screen size (with size breaks at 700px and 1000px, respectively).
